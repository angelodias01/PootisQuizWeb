<h2># Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello and thanks for reading this file! This file will show you everything we have in mind for this project about a quiz, and also some more extras!</p>

![PootisQuiz Logo](https://github.com/angelodias01/PootisQuizWeb/blob/master/public/pootisquiz.svg)

<h2># Our Goal</h2>

<p>This project has as it's main goal to make a quiz on an android enviroment with the resource of "Android Studio" in order to test our users knowledge, make some fun tests, get little competitions within our userbase or just for them to have a little fun! In order to better achieve this, we are using the framework "Laravel" in order to have an introductory website about our app to our users, and to also make every CRUD operation in the reserved space for the admins, in the website. For this, we used JAVA for the mobile app, and HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, BLADE and SQL for all our needs in the making of the website. With this (API), we were able to create a conection from the website into the mobile app!
<br>
 
<br>
You can find the mobile app here: https://github.com/JustaStudent01/Quiz 
</p>

<h2># Improvements</h2>

<p>This project is meant to be some sort of upgrade to the previous projects we have develoaped (first a quiz made on console using BlueJ, then the mobile app with a local database and with a small introductory website using Android Studio and VS code, and now a well made website with full conection to the app using Android Studio again and PHP Storm). Based on all that was achieved, we highly consider this shows an upgrade in our other projects.
   <br>
   The console app is available on another repository, if you want to check: https://github.com/JustaStudent01/QuizConsoleApp. With this new project, we hope to improved some features and even add some more, created a good interface for the app and website, have a better login/accounts system (with password encryptation, for example) and made the app more challenging and rewarding.</p>

<h2># Programs used</h2>

<p>GitHub, Android Studio, PHP Storm, SQL, ROOM database (SQLite), Adobe Ilustrator, Github Desktop</p>

<h2># Roadmap</h2>

<p>Here are the order of the steps we are taking to develoap this application:</p>

<p>1. Analyse the problem - the developers sad, searched and discussed what problems could rise and how to solve those problems.</p>
<p>2. Order the tasks to do among the members and find the solution to the problem - prioritize tasks among team members based on skills and allocate solutions to identified issues</p>
<p>3. Begin to solve the problem and add features - initiate problem-solving with a clear understanding of issues. Implement changes and introduce features to address challenges.</p>
<p>4. Use the tools available in order to improve the task solving - utilize software tools, frameworks, and methodologies to enhance efficiency in task-solving processes.</p>
<p>5. Implement a scalable architecture - adopt a structured architectural pattern, such as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), to enhance the organization of the application. This separation of concerns facilitates maintainability by isolating the user interface from the underlying business logic.</p>
<p>6. Give some quality of life improvements to the project - address bugs, refine features, and add functionalities to enhance user experience and project quality.</p>
<p>7. Test with users - gather feedback from users to evaluate usability, functionality, and overall user experience, ensuring the product meets expectations.</p>
